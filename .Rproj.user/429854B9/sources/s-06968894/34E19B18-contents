The advent of social media and streaming services like Spotify, Youtube,
and Instagram have given artists of all kinds unprecendented ability to
connect their work to their audience (SOURCE?). However, the increased
supply of artists makes it harder for each to cut through the noise and
reach financial freedom from their craft (SOURCE?).

Throughout history, artists have had to earn the accolades of their fan.
Yatta yatta, that's still true, but this paper explores how the
introduction of internet media changes the economic incentives and
decisions of artists.

This paper develops and analyzes a model of how artists build and
maintain a reputation. This paper pulls from the cultural economics of
(Rosen, 1981) and the branding literature (Klein \& Leffler, 1981;
Shapiro, 1983).

Modeling an artist's optimal behavior in the media streaming market
connects multiple broader fields of research. The first group is
cultural economics which applies economic ideas to the markets for
cultural goods. Relevant to the media streaming economy is

\subsubsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

I will now outline a model of how artistic reputation develops over
time. To do this, I will first examine the consumer's problem in which
she decides to consume a quantity of different artists' work taking as
given the price and current reputation of the firm. The consumer's
consumption choice will specify a demand function relating quantity
consumed to price and current reputation. The artist (firm) takes the
demand function and their current reputation as given and sets a price
of their work which determines present profit and next period's
reputation. The artist chooses prices in every period that maximize
their discounted lifetime profits.

\hypertarget{the-consumers-problem}{%
\subsubsection{The Consumer's Problem}\label{the-consumers-problem}}

I begin by assuming that there exists a representative consumer who
spends an amount \(E\) on artistic goods in every period. I assume that
the value of art, does not come from a single good but from the
portfolio of art that the consumer purchases. I additionally assume that
the value of art fully depreciates after each period \textbf{THIS
ASSUMPTION IS UBER-DUBIOUS BUT FIXING IT WOULD LIKELY BE INTRACTABLE}.
\textbf{I GUESS IF OUR MOTIVATING EXAMPLE IS GOING TO CONCERTS THEN IT'S
ALMOST OKAY BUT THAT MIGHT REQUIRE A DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL} I assume
that there exists a continuum of partially substitutable artists indexed
by \(i\in[0,N]\), where \(N\) parametrizes the total number of artists.
The consumer derives utility from the amount of art she consumes from
artist \(i\), denoted \(n(i)\) as well as the reputation of the artist,
\(r(i)\), that she consumes from. In addition, I add an idiosyncratic
and exogenous consumer preference parameter for each firm,
\(\alpha(i)\). I enter these three preference parameters
multiplicatively following (Rosen, 1981) which gives them a high degree
of substitutability. These assumptions are conducive to the
now-canonical monopolistic competition model presented in (Dixit \&
Stiglitz, 1977). As such I let consumer utility be given by: \[
U=\left(\int_{0}^N\alpha(i)r(i)n(i)^\rho di\right)^\frac{1}{\rho}
\]

We assume that consumers take the price for a certain artist's work as
given, denoted \(p(i)\).

As such, the consumer's only choice variable is number of units to
consume from each artist, \(n(i)\). She chooses this bundle to maximize
her utility subject to her budget constraint:
\(\int_0^N n(i)p(i)di\leq E\).

The Marshallian demand under the Dixit-Stiglitz formulation is: \[
n^*(i)=\left(P\frac{\alpha(i)r(i)}{p(i)}\right)^\sigma\frac{E}{P}
\]

Where the elasticity of substitution is given by
\(\sigma=\frac{1}{1-\rho}\), and the aggregate reputation-adjusted price
level is
\(P=\left[\int_0^N\left(\frac{\alpha(\omega)r(\omega)}{p(\omega)}\right)^\sigma p(\omega)d\omega\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}\).
Since there are a continuum of firms, price changes from a finite or
countably infinite number of firms has no affect on the aggregate price
level, \(P\).

The expression above gives the Marshallian demand for art from artist
\(i\) in terms of the price that artist \(i\) sets and the reputation
they have in the current period. The artist will use this demand
function when deciding the optimal price level to set.

\hypertarget{consumer-comparative-statics-needs-updating}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Consumer Comparative Statics \textbf{NEEDS
UPDATING}}{Consumer Comparative Statics NEEDS UPDATING}}\label{consumer-comparative-statics-needs-updating}}

First note that finite or countably infinite changes to idiosyncratic
preferences, reputation, or prices have no affect on the aggregate price
level \(P\) because the integral weighs an uncountably infinite number
of artists. As such, for an artist \(i\) finite or countably infinite
changes in tastes, preferences, and prices of \emph{other} artists have
no effect on how much quantity is demanded for artist \(i\).

Some of the results below depend on whether or not the constant
elasticity, \(\sigma\lesseqgtr1\). If the elasticity of substitution is
greater than \(1\), then small changes to the price of one good causes
disproportionately large changes tp the demand for other goods. This
sort of behavior is likely inconsistent with the art market where we
should expect price effects to dissipate over the continuum of sellers,
not amplify. With that, for the purposes of this analysis, we assume
that \(\sigma<1\).

Beginning with comparative statics, for any artist \(i\), increases to
the taste parameter satisfy \(n_\alpha>0\). Additionally, increases to
reputation increase demand for a good because \(n_r>0\). Increases to an
individual artist's price decrease consumption as expected, so
\(n_p<0\). Further note that increases to income increase consumption as
expected, \(n_I>0\).

\textbf{THE FOLLOWING RESULTS MAY REQUIRE SOME INADA-TYPE THINGS, AND
SHOULD ALSO MAYBE BE \(\geq\) AND NOT \(>\), SHOULD WORK THROUGH
TOGETHER}

In terms of the overall price level, \(n_P>0\). This result stems from
our assumption that \(v''(g)<0\), which implies that \([v']^{-1}\) is
also decreasing. Under the assumption that \(\sigma<1\), \(n_P>0\), so
increases to the overall price level increase consumption of each
artistic good. This is equivalent to saying that the substitution effect
dominates the income effect.

Finally, increasing the number of firms, the \(N\) in the upper bound of
the integral, also satisfies \(n_N>0\), so holding other things equal
more competition generates more consumer demand for each individual
artist. One might interpret this result as the effect of genres of art
benefiting from having more artists in that genre.

\hypertarget{the-artists-problem}{%
\subsubsection{The Artist's Problem}\label{the-artists-problem}}

We model the artist's problem dynamically. Let the artist have
underlying artistic talent \(\kappa\) (it can be viewed as a relative of
capital). The market is assumed to be monopolistically competitive, so
every artist has full control of their price in every period, but price
decisions may cause consumers to substitute to other products. The
artist takes their current reputation as given. This assumption is used
to simplify analysis. Allowing a flexible reputation in the current
period obfuscates how reputation evolves by allowing producers to
increase there reputation more quickly. As argued above, consumer demand
is a function of both price and reputation. However, with the fixed
reputation, the artist only has access to a single demand curve in each
period. Changes to reputation in future periods shift the artist's
available demand curve. This can be represented graphically in the
following way.

\includegraphics{Draft5_files/figure-latex/make demand plot-1.pdf}

To begin, I will take a two period case. We begin by assuming that the
artist starts with reputation \(r_0\). In period one, the artist chooses
an amount to produce, \(n_1\), and an amount to invest, \(I\) in their
next period's reputation. We assume that investment is transformed into
reputation according to \(f(I)\) with next period's reputation, \(r'\),
given by \(r'=\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I)\).

In period \(2\), the artist inherits their reputation \(r'\) and chooses
a quantity to produce \(n_2\). The artist's intertemporal problem is to
maximize their discounted profits over the two periods. This discounted
profit function is given by: \[
\Pi=p(n_1,r_0)n_1-C(n_1)-I+\beta(p(n_2,r')n_2-C(n_2)) \ s.t. r'=\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I)
\]

We can treat this an unconstrained multivariable maximization problem by
substituting in for \(r'\). Doing so yields the three following first
order conditions:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial n_1}&\colon p_n(n_1,r_0)n_1+p(n_1,r_0)-C'(n_1)=0\\
\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial n_2}&\colon p_n(n_2,\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I))n_2+p(n_2,\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I))-C'(n_2)=0\\
\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial I}&-1+\beta p_r(n_2,\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I))\cdot f'(I)\cdot n_2=0\\
\end{aligned}
\]

First note that the first order condition for \(n_1\) is decoupled from
all other first order conditions, so we can solve for \(n_1^*\) in
isolation.

The other two first order conditions we have to work a bit harder for.
Using the fact that \(np_n(\cdot)=-\frac{1}{\sigma}p(\cdot)\), we can
simply the first order conditions to: \[
\begin{aligned}
\left(1-\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)p(n_2,\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I))-C'(n_2)&=0\\
-1+\frac{\beta f'(I)n_2}{\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I)}p(n_2,\kappa(1-\delta)r_0+f(I))&=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Without functional form assumptions on the cost function and the
investment productivity funciton, we can't go any further, but we still
can discuss comparative statics given some weak assumptions on the
behavior of cost and investment functions respectively.

\hypertarget{production-comparative-statics}{%
\subsubsection{Production Comparative
Statics}\label{production-comparative-statics}}

Entering into comparative statics, we need a few assumptions. Beginning
with \(\sigma\), the elasticity of substitution. I will assume that
\(\sigma<1\) becuase we should expect the effect of price changes in one
good to disapate over the other goods, not amplify.

I will further assume that both \(C'(n)\) and \(C''(n)\) are positive,
so increasing production increases cost and at an increasing rate.

With that, the effect of increasing \(\kappa\) the talent parameter is
ambiguous and depends on the sign of
\(\left(1-\frac{\sigma}\right)p_n(n_2,r')-C''(n_2)\) at the optimum.

So long as reputation is increasing in investment, we have that
increasing talent \(\kappa\) decreases investment. Similarly, increasing
reputation depreciation has an ambiguous effect on production, \(n_2\),
but increases reputation investment. Finally increasing initial
reputation has an ambiguous effect on quantity produced and an negative
effect on investment.

\hypertarget{steady-state-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Steady State Analysis}\label{steady-state-analysis}}

The above derivation is hard to take any further, but in the steady
state equilibrium we can drop the time subscripts and solve for \(n\).
This gives:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left[cn+p(\frac{1}{\sigma}-1)\right]n&=\beta\gamma n\left[cn-\left(2-\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)p\right]\\
cn+p(\frac{1}{\sigma}-1)&=\beta\gamma \left[cn-\left(2-\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)p\right]\\
(1-\beta\gamma)cn&= -\beta\gamma\left(2-\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)p-p\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}-1\right)\\
(1-\beta\gamma)cn&= \beta\gamma\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}-2\right)p-p\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}-1\right)\\
(1-\beta\gamma)cn/p&= \beta\gamma\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}-2\right)-\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}-1\right)\\
(1-\beta\gamma)cn/p&= (\beta\gamma-1)\frac{1}{\sigma}-2\beta\gamma+1\\
(1-\beta\gamma)cn/p&= (\beta\gamma-1)\frac{1}{\sigma}+(1-\beta\gamma)-\beta\gamma\\
cn/p&= -\frac{1}{\sigma}+1-\frac{\beta\gamma}{(1-\beta\gamma)}\\
cn/p&= 1-\frac{1}{\sigma}-\frac{\beta\gamma}{(1-\beta\gamma)}\\
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{HOWEVER, THE TERM ABOVE ON THE RHS IS LESS THAN ZERO BC
\(\sigma<1\) SO EITHER I'VE MADE A MISTAKE OR THERE IS NO STEADY STATE}

And it's actually less than zero not because of the convexity of cost in
\(n\) (in fact any positive exponent on \(n\) will still give this
undesirable result.) Actually, you can even get this result with only an
increasing cost function, so no functional form required. Also changing
\(\mathcal{R}_n\) such that increases to quantity increase reputation
still has this terrible negative quantity produced business. That seems
to indicate to me that there just may not be a steady state.
