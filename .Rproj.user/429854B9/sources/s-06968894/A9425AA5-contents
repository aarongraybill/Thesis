## Big Idea

- Current model is a lot of economics, but I feel like I've lost what the model is tied to in real life.

- I will propose a motivating example and an idea for model it.

## More on Motivation:

### Some technical problems in the model I've been building

- A few problems with the model I was building
  - Durable goods not addressed
  - Assumption that increased sales decrease reputation
  - Media streaming should be modeled with a time constraint (not budget)
  
### Bigger picture problem
  
- Other problem, I don't know what my model models. 
  - At least it doesn't feel like art markets these days truly behave this way
